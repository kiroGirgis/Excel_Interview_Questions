1) What is an array formula, and how does it differ from a regular formula?

ANSWER:
An array formula performs multiple calculations on a range of values and returns one or multiple results. It works on arrays instead of single values like regular formulas.

2) How would you combine data from multiple worksheets into a single summary sheet dynamically?

ANSWER:
You can combine data from multiple worksheets using consolidate tool, power Query(prefered for large datasets), or VBA mainly for automating data extraction from multiple sheets

3) How would you use power Query to clean and transform data? Can you derscribe a step-by-step example?

ANSWER:
Power Query automates data cleaning and transformation:
Load Data:
Go to Data > Get Data and import your dataset.
Transform Data: Remove blank rows, errors, and duplicates.
Split columns, trim spaces, and filter rows.
Change Data Types: Ensure columns have correct formats (e.g., Date, Number, Text).
Combine Data: Append or merge queries from multiple sources.
Load Cleaned Data: Click Close & Load to output the cleaned data into Excel.

4) How do you use Excel Advanced filter to extract unique records or filter data with criteria?

ANSWER
1- Go to Data > Advanced Filter.
2- Choose Copy to Another Location.
3- Check Unique Records Only to remove duplicates.
4- Use a criteria range to apply complex filters.

5) What is a scenario where you would use Excel Goal Seek, solver, or what-if Analysis tools?

ANSWER:
Goal Seek: Use when you know the desired result and need to find the input value.
Example: To find the required interest rate for a loan payment of $500.
Solver: Use for complex optimization problems with constraints.
Example: Maximize profits by adjusting production levels.
What-If Analysis: Use to analyze scenarios based on different inputs.
Example: Create a Scenario Summary for high, medium, and low sales estimates.

6) How would you create a dependent drop-down list in Excel?
ANSWER:
Use Data Validation with INDIRECT. Create named ranges for the primary and dependent lists, then use INDIRECT(reference) in Data Validation for the second list.

7) What is the difference between INDEX-MATCH and VLOOKUP? Why would you use one over the other?
ANSWER:
INDEX-MATCH is more flexible, works with data in any direction, and performs better on large datasets, unlike VLOOKUP, which requires a fixed column reference.

8) How do you create a dynamic named range?
ANSWER:
Use the OFFSET or INDEX function in the Name Manager:
=OFFSET(Sheet1!$A$1,0,0,COUNTA(Sheet1!$A:$A),1)

9) How do you apply array formulas in Excel using dynamic arrays (e.g., UNIQUE, SORT, FILTER)?
ANSWER: 
Use functions like =UNIQUE(A1:A100), =SORT(A1:A100), and =FILTER(A1:C100, B1:B100>50). These formulas spill results dynamically into adjacent cells.

10) What is Power Pivot, and how does it differ from regular Pivot Tables?
ANSWER: 
Power Pivot allows working with large datasets, creating data models, and using DAX formulas for more complex calculations compared to standard Pivot Tables.

11) What are DAX formulas, and how do they enhance data analysis in Power Pivot?
ANSWER:
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is a formula language used in Power Pivot for advanced calculations, like CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amount]), Sales[Region]="West").

12) How do you create a rolling average in Excel?
ANSWER:
Use the AVERAGE formula with OFFSET or INDEX:
=AVERAGE(OFFSET(A2,COUNT(A:A)-5,0,5,1)) (calculates a rolling 5-period average).

13) How do you create a macro to automate repetitive Excel tasks?
ANSWER: 
Use VBA: Open the Developer tab, record a macro, edit the VBA script, and assign it to a button for automation.

14) What are the differences between absolute, relative, and mixed cell references in Excel?
ANSWER:
Absolute ($A$1): Fixed reference.
Relative (A1): Adjusts when copied.
Mixed ($A1 or A$1): One part fixed, the other adjusts.

15) How can you use the XLOOKUP function, and how does it improve upon VLOOKUP?
ANSWER:
=XLOOKUP(lookup_value, lookup_array, return_array, [if_not_found], [match_mode], [search_mode])
Unlike VLOOKUP, it searches left, returns multiple columns, and handles errors better.

16) How would you create a waterfall chart in Excel to visualize financial data?
ANSWER:
Insert a Waterfall Chart from the Charts section and categorize data as Increase, Decrease, and Total.

17) How do you use Excel's Get & Transform (Power Query) to merge two datasets?
ANSWER: 
Load both datasets in Power Query → Merge Queries → Define a common key → Expand merged data.

18) How would you use VBA to automate a repetitive task like formatting reports?
ANSWER:
Write a VBA script in the Developer tab, such as:
Sub FormatReport()
    Columns("A:E").AutoFit
    Range("A1:E1").Font.Bold = True
    MsgBox "Report formatted!"
End Sub

19) 
How do you use Data Validation with custom formulas to restrict data entry?
ANSWER:
Use formulas like =ISNUMBER(A1) in Data Validation to allow only numeric entries.

20) How would you use the SEQUENCE and RANDARRAY functions in Excel?
ANSWER:
=SEQUENCE(10,1,1,1) generates a list from 1 to 10.
=RANDARRAY(5,1,1,100,TRUE) creates 5 random whole numbers between 1 and 100.
